# Security Training Studio

A browser-based Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for security professionals to build decision-making, coordination and situational awareness skills.
It features individual scenario training, team-coordination drills, and an interactive scenario library built around the OODA loop and use-of-force considerations.

### 🎯 Features

Solo Training: Self-paced, timed scenarios with branching choices, immediate feedback and scoring.

Team Coordination: Live multi-tab or device drills using BroadcastChannel (no server required) for marker placement, comms and simulated coordination tasks.

Scenario Library: Easily add, filter and preview decision-making scenarios—now includes an OODA Loop Trainer module.

After-Action Review (AAR): Replay past sessions with event logs (chat, status, markers) for debrief and improvement.

High‐Contrast Dark UI: Built with accessibility in mind for tactical-lighting environments.

Modular Structure: Built in React + Typescript + Vite, with clean component/data separation to simplify tailoring and deployment.

### 🧠 Intended Use

This simulator is not a substitute for certified instructor-led firearms or defensive tactics training. It focuses solely on decision-making, communication, ethics and coordination under pressure.

If you like, I can craft a full README.md template with sections for architecture, deployment, data/JSON contributions, scenario-creation guidelines and license info.
